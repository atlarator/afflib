        is more 'public domain' that 'BSD-4-clause'. More details in
        COPYING and doc/announce_3.7.txt files. So, changing to
        'public domain' as main license.
  * debian/libafflib0.install: added support to multiarch paths.
  * debian/libafflib-dev.install: added support to multiarch paths.
  * debian/libafflib0.symbols: added to provide symbols to
      libafflib.so.0.0.0
  * debian/patches/:
      - fix_typos_spellings_in_tools: created to fix spelling errors,
        typos and to apply the correct names of the binaries inside the
        source code.
      - fix_affcat_manpage: fix the binary name inside the manpage.
  * debian/README.source: removed the information about patches using
      quilt (no longer necessary) and added a notice about upstream
      tarball repack.
  * debian/source/options: added to ignore some changes in files, made
      by upstream code, when compiling.
  * debian/rules:
      - Added the DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS variable to fix the issues
        pointed by blhc.
      - Updated the override_dh_auto_configure target to allow the
        GCC hardening.
      - Updated the override_dh_auto_install target to work with
        multiarch paths.
  * debian/watch: fixed and improved.

afflib (3.5.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: don't build-depend on libfuse-dev on the Hurd, as we

  * debian/rules:

      on arch-dep packages.
  * debian/patches:
    - 01-fix-afrecover.patch: new patch, make afrecover prints its real name
      to stdout in usage().
    - 99-no_static_ldflags.patch, new patch: drop `-static` from LDFLAGS from
      tools/Makefile.am in order to avoid afflib-tools to be statically
      linked against libafflib.

    pass '--with autotools_dev' to dh in order to automatically update
